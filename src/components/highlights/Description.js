                <h2>About Her</h2>
                <div className="highlight_description">
                    She is the most beautiful girl on this planet. 
                    Amazing, wonderful, beautiful, and absolutely the most precious person in my life.
                    When I think of the word 'love', she is the first thing that comes to my mind.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Life without her feels meaningless. When I'm not with her, all I do is think about her.
                    When I think about her, I just want to be with her. And when I'm with her,
                    it feels like all my dreams have come true — the only place I want to be is closer to her.
                    <br/><br/>
                    She is my everything — my North, South, East, and West,
                    my busy weekdays and my peaceful Sundays. I could walk forever with her by my side.
                    God was definitely showing off when he created her. Her parents must be magicians because they put all the stars from the sky into her eyes.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Before I met her, I never knew what it was like to smile for no reason. 
                    If I had to choose between breathing and loving her, I would use my last breath to say — I LOVE YOU.
                    Every time I look into her eyes, I fall in love all over again.
                    <br/><br/>
                    She deserves the world, and even though I can't give her that, I'll give her something better — my world.
                    I love you, my Vanilla! Every time I see you, I just want to hold you and never let go. 
                    You fill all the empty spaces in my heart with light, my sweet Peaches.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Grow old with me — the best is yet to come. I don't want to be your favorite or your best.
                    I want to be your only one. ❤️
