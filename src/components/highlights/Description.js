                <h2>About Her</h2>
                <div className="highlight_description">
                    She is the most beautiful girl on Planet Earth.
                    She is so amazingly...wondefully...beautifully...awesomely... most definitely the most precious of all precious things.
                    The first thing I imagined when I saw the word 'love' is her.
                    Life without her is like a broken pencil: ponitless. I miss
                    her when I'm not with her. When I'm not with her, all I do is think about her.
                    When I think about her, I just want to be with her. When I'm with her,
                    it's look like all of my dreams have come true and the only place I want to be is closer. I can forget my very existence in a deep kiss with her. 
                    She is my North, South, my East and West,
                    my working week and my Sunday rest. I could walk forever and a mile with her. 
                    God was showing off when he created her. Her parents are the thieves because the stole all the stars in the sky and put them in her eyes.
                    Before I met her, I never knew what it was like to smile for no reason. If I had to choose between breathing and loving her, I would use my last breath to say, I LOVE YOU.
                    Are you Google? Cause you've got everything I've been searching for. I fall in love with you everytime I look into your eyes.
                    You deserve the world, and I know I can't give that to you. So I'll give you the next best thing: My World.
                    I Love you BOOO, and everytime I see you, I want to hold you in my arms and never let go. You're the girl that fills all the little dark places in my heart.
                    Please, Grow old along with me! The best is yet to come. I don't want to be your best or your favorite. I want to be your only and forget the rest.
